low-level RPC calls, to running a full-fledged daemon that will manage
rTorrent according to user-defined rules.

## Acknowledgements

All programs stand on the shoulders of giants, and the giant
for this one is the great [pyrocore toolset](https://github.com/pyroscope/pyrocore).
Much of the code has been refactored, but the base structure and concepts are the same.
