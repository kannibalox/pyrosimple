# pyrosimple

Welcome to pyrosimple, a collection of tools for working with rTorrent. With pyrosimple,
you can do everything ranging from making low-level RPC calls, to running a full-fledged daemon that
will manage rTorrent according to user-defined rules.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pyrosimple
# pip install 'pyrosimple[torque]' # Optional dependencies, for advanced features
```

## Getting started

See the [Quick Start](quickstart.md) for getting pyrosimple up and running quickly.

## Acknowledgements

Almost all programs stand on the shoulders of giants, and the giant for this one is the great [pyrocore toolset](https://github.com/pyroscope/pyrocore).
Much of the code has been refactored, but the base structure and concepts are the same.
