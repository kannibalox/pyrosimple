# Experimental Features

## Query optimization

!!! Requirements

    *rTorrent* must support the `d.multicall.filtered` method, which requires vanilla version 0.9.8+,
    or rTorrent-PS 1.1+.

If your rTorrent supports `d.multicall.filtered`, rtcontrol can take
advantage of it to return results faster. The option is controlled by
the `-Q` flag in rtcontrol, or `fast_query` in the configuration file.

Level `1` is less aggressive and safe by definition (i.e. produces
correct results in all cases, unless there's a bug), while ``-Q2`` is
highly experimental and in some circumstances likely produces results
that are too small or empty.

Optimization works by giving a pre-filter condition to rTorrent,
to reduce the overhead involved in sending items over XMLRPC and
processing them, only to be then discarded in the ``rtcontrol`` filter
machinery.

This goal of reducing the number of items sent to ``rtcontrol`` is
best achieved if you put a highly selective condition first in a
series of conditions. For cron-type jobs, this can often be achieved
by looking at recent items only – older items should already be
processed by previous runs. Even a very lenient window like “last
week” drastically reduces items that need to be processed.

```bash
$ rtcontrol loaded=-6w is_ignored=0 -o- -v -Q0

## Connecting to multiple clients

!!! warning

    This can cause strange behavior unless planned out. For instance, hashes are no longer enough to uniquely identify a torrent.

`rtxmlrpc` and `rtcontrol` support talking to multiple clients, by
specifying a TOML list in the `CONNECTIONS` section:
```toml
[CONNECTIONS]
local="localhost:7000"
remote="remote.example.com:7000"
seedbox="https://username:password@seedbox.example.com"
all=["local","seedbox","remote"]
```
```bash
rtxmlrpc -U all system.hostname
```

## Connecting over SSH

!!! Requirements

    `socat` is required to be installed on the remote server for this functionality.
    SSH authentication must also happen without any prompts, (i.e. through `authorized_keys`
    or a SSH agent that holds your password)

```bash
# Via port
rtxmlrpc -U scgi+ssh://example.com/TCP:0.0.0.0:7000 system.hostname
# Via domain socket
rtxmlrpc -U scgi+ssh://example.com/UNIX-CONNECT:/home/rtorrent/scgi.sock system.hostname
```

Since each command opens a new SSH connection, setting up the
ControlPersist feature in `~/.ssh/config` is highly recommended.

Example:
```
Host *
  ControlMaster auto
  ControlPath ~/.ssh/sockets/%r@%h-%p
  ControlPersist 600
```

## JSON-RPC

!!! Requirements

    Currently JSON-RPC is only supported by jesec-rtorrent: [https://github.com/jesec/rtorrent]().
    Pyrosimple supports this fork, but it is not maintained by the official rTorrent author (rakshasa).

[JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) is an light-weight
RPC mechanism that is a nearly drop-in replaceable for XMLRPC, while
having a much smaller message size and being faster to parse/produce.

Pyrosimple handles converting commands between JSON and XML
automatically, so enabling JSON-RPC for a given host is as simple as
appending `?rpc=json` to the URL.

```toml
[CONNECTIONS]
socket_json_host = "scgi://localhost:9988?rpc=json"
http_json_host = "http://localhost:8080/RPC2?rpc=json"
```

Note that there are some minor differences between command names
between jesec-rtorrent and vanilla. `rtcontrol` will attempt to handle
them automatically, while `rtxmlrpc` will not.

!!! warning

    There is only one main limitation to the current JSON-RPC implementation: it cannot handle binary
    data types, which primarily effects the `load.*.raw` commands. jesec-rtorrent has made it so that
    the non-raw `load.*` commands can now accept base64-style URLs, which is intended to be a replacement.

    ```toml
    # XMLRPC
    rtxmlrpc load.raw_verbose '' <base64 data>
    # jesec-rtorrent's JSON-RPC
    rtxmlrpc load.verbose '' data:base64,<base64 data>
    ```
